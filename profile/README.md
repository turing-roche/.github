# Welcome to the Turing-Roche Partnership GitHub Organisation

## üó∫Ô∏èBackground

Our five year strategic partnership between the Alan Turing Institute and Roche officially launched in June 2021 following a successful [Turing Institute Data Study Group Hackathon](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/publications/data-study-group-final-report-roche) and a 12 week research project on lung cancer treatment. 
 
The **'North Star'** of our five year partnership is to _enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care_. Put simply we are developing new data science methods to investigate large, complex, clinical and healthcare datasets to better understand how and why patients respond differently to treatment, and how treatment can be improved.

We are covering multiple research and community activities to work towards our North Star, as well as building strong connections and collaborations between the Alan Turing Institute, Roche and the wider community.

Here you can find repositories containing our project and community related documentation and also repositiories linked to our research.
